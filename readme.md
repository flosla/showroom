This repository shows my personal projects in the field of Data Science, Machine Learning and Analytics.
Feel free to take a look and ping me if you have any questions about it.

The following projects can be found in here:

1. Global Internet Speed Analysis using the CRISP-DM Method.
This project analysis the correlation between global internet speed (mobile and broadband) and other variables such as GDP per capita, internet usage rate and urbanization rate. The methodology applied is the CRISP-DM model, a commonly used standard for Data Mining processes. Regarding statistical analysis, I used a spearman correlation to determine potential relationships of the variables.
The technologies used were Python libraries, Jupyter Notebook and Markup Language for Documentation.

2. Relaunch of Digital Economy Club Website
Wordpress based Webdesign using Elementor PageBuilder and additional plug-ins such as WPForms (for event management) and stripe for online payment processing.

3. Airline Passenger Satisfaction
R-based project applying CRISP-DM model on airlines' passenger satisfaction in different price categories (economy, business).
